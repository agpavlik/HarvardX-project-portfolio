Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


I decided to create a site that will be realy useful. So, as you recomended, here is the site about myself, so-called my bussiness card.

The title page (index.html) was realised with help of the Bootstrap using a grid model. There are two components navbar and carousel were performed. By the way the pictures in the carousel have hiperlinks. Other pages (cv.html, prof.html, contacts.html) show a table, list and form. Also, there are some pages which do not have any information yet (cooking.html, family.html, it.html, projects.html, sport.html, traveling.html). Of course, there are some stylesheets that use planty of CSS properties and selectors including hover and the mobile-responsive @media query. The CSCC variable, nesting, inheritance are present here as well.
