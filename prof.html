                        	<p class="smaller-size">On the one hand, the real estate market is just an ordinary market, the same as many others. On the other hand, the real estate market has its own characteristics and peculiarities. In any case, everyone would agree that the real estate plays an important role in society. Therefore, the main issue of current article is to give some insight into the features of the real estate market.<br><br>First of all, as probably every aspect of public life, the real estate market has a cyclical development. The periods of upward price trend change the periods of downward price trend. As well as, the growth of demand then change its decrease. Actually, a full cycle of the real estate development can be explained as a circle consisting of four different stages. The first stage is <i>the gradual development.</i> At this stage, both the demand and the real estate price are growing gradually. The second stage is <i>the real estate market boom.</i> At this stage, the demand still continues to grow but the price for real estate is growing much faster. Mainly this happens due to the lack of supply of the real estate. The third stage is <i>the crisis.</i> The price and the demand have reached a peak and then the demand starts to decrease. Sellers start to reduce price in order to keep the demand high. The fourth stage can be called as <i>the bottom and depressive stabilization.</i> The demand falls dramatically and sellers try to sell the real estate for more or less satisfactory price. Therefore, price also decreases drastically. Both are reaching the bottom where stabilization occurs. After that, the first stage is starting again. Of course, every stage may take different period of time. Unfortunately, it is impossible to predict when one stage is over and another starts.<br><br>The second point, which is necessary to mention, is that the real estate market is one of the crucially important parts of economy and is strongly connected to probably every sphere of economy. Actually, the real estate market one of the first feels the upcoming economic crisis. It happens simply because when people face lack of money they primarily buy essentials, then things they may need in the near future, then cars, and the last thing people buy is the real estate. Definitely, the real estate like an apartment or a private house are much more expensive in comparison with other property. Well, it looks like a pyramid constructed from people's needs and possibilities. The real estate, obviously, is far away from the top of such pyramid. Furthermore, when the economic crisis ends, the real estate market recovers among the last. Therefore, when the main economic indicators show that the country started to go out of a crisis, it is the best time to invest in the real estate.<br><br>The third point, which is important to explain, is a so called <i>real estate bubble.</i> The brief concept of such event is that the price of real estate starts to increase rapidly under the influence of various factors conditioned by the supply or demand. This increase is much faster than the dynamics of the inflation level or GDP level. Investment in real estate becomes more lucrative then investment in financial instruments, e.g. bank deposits or various businesses. In these situation people can buy an apartment and sell it a year later with 20% margin or even higher. On the one hand, it looks nice. But on the other hand, in reality, such a real estate bubble does not have economic background and eventually culminates in price collapse. So, it leads to the problem for lots of people, for the banking sector and for the economy of a country as whole. Economists try to elaborate various models in order to identify and prevent the real estate bubble early on. Unfortunately, there is no universal flawless model yet. So, nowadays, it is still impossible to predict the exact date of bubble burst.<br><br>To conclude all the mentioned above, it is necessary to say that for those people who wants to buy or sell real estate it is important to analyze different investigation and researches of the real estate market. But, at the same time, it should be taken into consideration that researchers and realtors have a tendency to extend the trends of previous period for the future period and try to avoid  making sharp controversial forecasts and predictions. So, in most of the cases, it would be possible to point out the date of a new turn of the real estate market only when it has already happened.

                        <h5 id="article2">Valuation of a factory as a complex of tangible properties</h5>
                        	<p class="smaller-size">Probably every appraiser from time to time faces the case when it is necessary to evaluate a factory as a complex of tangible assets. There is quite a simple algorithm for valuation of a whole factory as functioning business that includes tangible and intangible assets. But the valuation of the tangible part only is quite challenging. Below, will be proposed the general explanation of the various methods that can be applied throughout the income approach, the cost approach and the sell comparison approach for valuation of a factory as a complex of tangible assets.<br><br>Firstly, <i>the income approach.</i> This approach is based on the expected future cash flow that can be accumulated by using the property, and transformation of this cash flow to the present value of the property. There are two main methods of calculation of the future cash flow. One of them is the calculation based on the rent income of the property. This method is applicable for the evaluation of the real estate that has more or less active rental market (retail, warehouse etc.). For the production premises this method is used rarely, because it is very difficult to take into account all the features of the object, especially, if the building has built-in equipment. Another method is the calculation based on income from the operating activities. The appraiser uses figures of income and loses provided by official reporting and management data. A significant drawback of this method is that it shows a so-called price of the whole business. Actually, it is the value of a complex of tangible and intangible assets (contracts with counterparties, licenses, trademark, etc.). At the same time, the possible way would be in estimation of the value of intangible assets and then determine the difference.  But, there is not any valid technique for estimation of intangible asset as a separate item. So, this method is used mainly for the estimation of corporate rights. Suchwise, the mentioned methods cannot demonstrate the realistic value of the tangible part of a plant. Usually, the first method shows the underestimated value and the second method shows the overestimated value. To summarize all mentioned above, one can conclude that the income approach cannot be used for estimation of the tangible part of a faсtory and can be used only as reference information.<br><br>Secondly,<i> the cost approach.</i> This approach is based on the determining of the current value of the cost of restoring or replacing the property and adjustment it for wear and tear. There are two main methods of the calculation of the cost of restoring or replacing the property. The first is, calculating based on the building construction estimate, cost of purchasing and installation of equipment provided by the property owner. Of course, there is a risk that this data is not completely correct. For example, the construction estimate can be underestimated because some expenses were not included, or versa vise, the construction estimate can be overestimated because an accountant did the cost indexation or included expenses which are not relevant to this construction estimate. Therefore, this method requires detailed analysis of received information (construction estimates, sales contracts, commissioning acts, balance sheet statements, etc.). Nevertheless, this method is considered to be one of the most objective. In addition, it is necessary to mention that it is better to use this method for valuation of objects no older than 10 years, because with the age increasing, the possibility of error increases as well. The second method is based on the information about  the cost of building of property, which would have the same usefulness as the estimated property. In this case, a different construction offer from reputable companies can be used. This method  is also considered as objective enough. As a rule, appraisers try to use both of the aforementioned methods in order to have the confirmation of one method by another or, at least, to have understanding of which method showed more realistic information. The cost approach is considered as the most objective for determining of the value of a factory as a complex of real estate and equipment. Although, under the conditions of economic downturn, when the real estate market is inactive, the market value of real estate can be significantly lower in comparison with the value of investment in its building.<br><br>Thirdly, <i>the sale comparison approach.</i> The essence of the sales comparison approach is in determining the value of property by comparing the prices of the recently sold similar properties. There are also two main methods. One is the evaluation of a factory as a complex of divided parts that are separately the real estate and all the equipment. This method is the most common, but sometimes it can lead to underestimation of the factory. The price of selling of the real estate and dismantled equipment would be lower in comparison with the price of a whole factory as a complex of tangible assets. Another method is the evaluation of a factory based on the industry multipliers. For example, a grain elevator is evaluated based on price of storage of one ton of grain and a hotel is evaluated based on price of one place for a visitor, etc. But, this method should be used carefully. On the one hand, it can show the most objective result in comparison with the cost approach and the income approach. On the other hand, the selling proposals of factories may contain intangible assets along with tangible assets. So, it is necessary to figure out of the selling proposals of factories in detail. Therefore, the sale comparison approach may be both, the most objective and the most doubtful one.<br><br>To summarize all the aforementioned, the process of valuation of a factory as a complex of tangible assets seems to be quite complicated and one valuation algorithm cannot be used  for different cases. It is necessary to use all three approaches, or at least two of them, the cost approach and the sale comparison approach, to obtain the most valid valuation result. </p>
